# Monopoly Simulation

A fast simulation of Monopoly, written in C++.

Motivation: Analysis of the game and development of player strategies. (Also: just see how fast it can be!)

The source code is stored at `MonopolySimulation/src/`. The repo has a Visual Studio 22 build setup because that's what I use, but you could easily extract the source for your build system of choice. C++20 support is required.
